# Hotel-Reservation
This is a project I had to do for a course. I just placed it here for save keeping as my first java application.
It is a hotel reservation app. 
In the hotel reservation app you are able to go to the admin settings and create rooms, see all rooms, see all customers and see all reservation. 
When you are in the main menu you are able to create and account and reserve a room.
